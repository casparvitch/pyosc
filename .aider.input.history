# 2025-07-09 14:52:56.299922
+/ask maybe we should use the widened region start here and go with option 1 (with that caveat)? thoughts?

+/ask how could we edit the code throughout to have a different scaling on the y-axis? It would be nice to see the events as % contrasts for example? Perhaps for a later date

# 2025-07-09 17:13:57.259674

# 2025-07-10 10:16:59.674230
+/ask ok I'm a little confused. The event plot has a very long title (could be over two lines or reduced font size I think), and the y-axis is still scaled in the same way? did we need to update the analysis script?

+/ask I don't think 'CONFIG' should be passed to the `process_file` function (it should just stay in the scripts). I would further like the option to set most of the filtering/etc. commands per-measurement (e.g. `MIN_EVENT_KEEP_SNR` inside `Measurements`). What do you think?

I do kind of like the salgov filter though

# 2025-07-10 16:00:47.587621

# 2025-07-10 16:13:14.560145
